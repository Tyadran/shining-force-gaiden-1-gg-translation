1c. Custom inserter tool


At this point, the number of small hacks are growing. To make this
more manageable, a simple program is written which will make maintenance
easier. It's written in regular C.

It will not create a backup file before writing in all the new changes.

Usage: rom_insert.exe <image name> <list name>

[See t1c_rom_insert.c for the source code]
[See rom_insert.exe for the binary executable]

To compile your own version, you can use the free gcc or vc compiler.


ex.

rom_insert.exe fc.gg list.txt

(list.txt)
; Menu 2-line names

3dfc t1.obj	; Scripting code
1033 t1_1.obj	; Support hack


The program only cares about the (address, file) pair.
Anything else is considered to be a comment and is ignored.

';' = forced comment
'#' = will skip any files below this marker until the next '#'
