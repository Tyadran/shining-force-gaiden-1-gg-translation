Full patch released at SFC by Moogie. 

Thanks go out to:
z80 gaiden 
 - what can I say, dude you're a star! Thanks for your patience :)
Heliophobe
ChrisRPG    
XeroBourne
 - thanks for offering to help in a time of need.
Aspartate  
Landius    
Lineage
 - without the three of you, this translation wouldn't be
   nearly so accurate.

Without these people, this patch would not have been possible.
Thanks also to the entire Shining Community for their patience
and support.

Finally, thanks to all the staff at Camelot, without whom we 
would never have had the oppportunity to play this game at all.
The series may not be what it used to be, but we'll keep its
spirit alive for its creators and its fans.

Keep on Shining
- Moogie
