9g. Using overscan time


A brief note that didn't readily become apparent.

The game only uses H-INT (firing IRQs or interrupts at a certain scanline - $A7).

V-INT (VBlank = scanline $C0) is turned off. So no automatic code jumping at the
start of the rendering wait period.

The effective drawing area is roughly between [$18,$A7]. Outside of here is 'dead'
overscan space. The VDP is still actively drawing but perhaps a solid color?

Regardless, this area could be better utilised. So 'RST 38H' gets a hit at $A7.
It turns off the screen (forced blanking) which disables VDP to LCD emissions.

A batch of unrolled OUTI's is used to quickly flood the VRAM with updates.
Screen gets turned back on after the quick modifications.

It buys the developers some more time, but at a small cost of H-INT handling.
