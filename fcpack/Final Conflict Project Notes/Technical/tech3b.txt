3b. Creating the inserter


To make sure that our semi-adaptive Huffman encoder works properly, we'll
re-insert the dumped binary script.

We'll adapt our old code to this new project and auto-setup the pointers
and page pointers.


The trees end at: 02ABE5. Normally stops at $2B798. Saved $BB3.
The compressed script weighs in at ~24 KB vs. ~26 KB.

So we're performing slightly better with the same exact data.
Re-decompressing via in-game shows nothing different.
