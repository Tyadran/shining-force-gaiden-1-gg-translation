0. Changing the font


At this point, it would be a good idea to replace the main font
at $2891F, not $28920.

The one from Shining Force II: Sword of Hajya (c) 1994 Sonic, Sega
keeps the same style but thickens the borders. It's nice enough
that we'll use it here for consistency.

Additional font characters are added and some are tweaked in this set.

$90+1 tiles = $91 * 4 bpp * 64 pixels = $1220 bytes to copy. ~$740 left.

We've got enough empty tiles leftover that we can defrag the room and
possibly even compress the existing data to save more space.

Or convert the tiles to 1-bpp format and expand to 4-bpp GG format at
run-time. Then copy them to VRAM at boot. It will start slower though so
that's a trade-off factor.
